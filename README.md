<p align="center"><b>Skip low-like short videos.</b><br>
A Chrome extension that skips YouTube Shorts, TikToks, and Instagram Reels with too few likes.<br>
Installed means on. No account, no setup.</p>

## What it does

Scroll like you always do. When a video has fewer likes than your minimum, ScrollPlus moves to the next one and tells you why. The Undo button appears for a few seconds; a video you restore stays for the browser session, including reloads and new tabs.

The default is simple: **skip anything under 5,000 likes**. Pick a different level in the popup, or set your own numbers in Settings.

| Preset | Skips videos under |
| --- | --- |
| Lenient | 1,000 likes |
| Balanced (default) | 5,000 likes |
| Strict | 20,000 likes |

In Settings you can also turn on a minimum for comments or views, switch a site off, and keep creators you like. Numbers can be typed the way you say them: `5k`, `2만`, `1,000`.

If a count is missing, the video stays. Ads and photo posts stay too. It never skips on a guess, never hides a feed, and stops after six skips in a row so you can decide to keep going or lower the bar.

Supported: YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels on the web, in English and Korean.

## Status

ScrollPlus is a public beta, installed from a GitHub release for now (see below).

- Tested on controlled pages for all three sites, including Chrome 120, the oldest supported version.
- Tried on real feeds: YouTube Shorts (a 24-hour automated run on 0.3.5, with two page-reload recoveries), TikTok For You, and Instagram Reels in a signed-in browser. Instagram Reels is the newest and least exercised site.
- Not yet established: ordinary day-long use, and the Instagram advertisement guard on a live advertisement.

Each claim is scoped in [release readiness](qa/release-readiness.md). More: [signed-in QA](qa/signed-in-smoke.md), [long feed QA](qa/soak.md), [UI audit](qa/ui-audit.md), [session Undo QA](qa/session-undo.md).

## Install

It is not on the Chrome Web Store yet. The quickest way to try the current beta is the zip on the [GitHub beta releases page](https://github.com/jeongjin0/scrollplus/releases): unzip it, open `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, and choose Load unpacked.

To update a beta, replace the contents of the unpacked folder you already loaded with the new ZIP's files, then click Reload on the ScrollPlus card in `chrome://extensions`. Keep only one copy enabled. Extension reloads clear temporary Undo choices.

To build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeongjin0/scrollplus.git
cd scrollplus
npm install
npm run build
```

Open `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, choose Load unpacked, and select `.output/chrome-mv3`. Chrome 120 or newer.

## Develop

```bash
npm test           # rule and number tests
npm run build
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e   # engine, built adapters, popup, settings, and storage
npm run compile    # type check
npm run dev        # live reload
npm run assets     # re-render the store images
node scripts/capture-ui.mjs  # capture English and Korean UI
```

The product rules are in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md). QA notes are in [qa/](qa). Contributions are welcome, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Privacy

ScrollPlus reads the counts the page has already loaded and decides on your device. Settings and today's skip count stay in Chrome storage; Undo choices stay only in memory until browser restart or Reset. Nothing is collected or sent anywhere. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

ScrollPlus is not affiliated with YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram.
